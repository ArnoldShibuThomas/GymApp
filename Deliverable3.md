# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details. Also make sure this thing is well formatted and the links are links in here. 

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Gym Scheduling

**Sprint Number:** 3

**Scrum Master**: William Mastronardi

**Git Master**: Arnold Shibu-Thomas

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** Update the user interface to best fit the project and ensure more testing and static analysis is done for better readable code.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  7

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 6
> Answer the questions below about your Sprint Planning?

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

> We added these user stories because thay appear to be stories that are important to the customer. We feel like we can get these UserStories done since they are extensions of previous user stories and these should be doable with our smaller team.

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

> They fit well with the sprint goal because they provide more features to the user interface and allow us enough time to get more testing done.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**: [Screencast](https://youtu.be/vYKgF-f-onI)

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> Alot if the customer requirements are now fully implemented on the front end via the GUI.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> Yes, considering that on top of assignments and the Thanksgiving holiday, we all manage to get commits in and move tasks on taiga.

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> Yes considering that most of the functionallity required was implemented and since only 2 task out of the tiaga board weren't complete. For a team of our size we met most of the customer's  requirements. The one's remaining, we weren't able to get to as a result of being understaffed and having less time as a result of holiday.


### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> Yes we met the sprint requirements we added more functionality to the UI and also made the code less error prone (thanks to the use of spotbugs and reducing violations there) and made the code more readable and mantainable (thanks to the use of checkstyles and reducing those violations).

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> No. 

**If not, what went wrong?**

> We completed most of the the userstories in this sprint. We were unable to get the 1 userstory this sprint but other than that we manage to complete eveything else. Time constraints (with regards to thanksgiving) and being understaffed were the main reason for the inability to fully complete. Also the tasks with regards the UI took a bit of time to research and debug on our end.

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> A bit of both we had commits and task being worked on early on but since they ended up being more complicated than what was to be expected it took a bit of time to finish them so most of the work was done and finalized closer to the deadline.

**Did you deliver business value?**

> Yes, we delivered business value since we now have alot more functionality for the customer to use on the GUI and the code is now better in terms of being less error prone and easier to maintain & read.

**Did you follow the Scrum process (e.g. move Tasks correctly?, keep the Taiga board up to date? work consistently?)**

> Yes, we worked with 2 task in progress each at a time and made sure to update the board every time a pull request was made

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint? (not needed for last Sprint)**

> N/A

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> Yes, alot more since we are finlized here.

### Contributions:

> In this section I want you to point me to your main contributions (each of you individually) for the current Sprint. Some of the below you will only need starting in later Sprints, I marked when they become important. 

#### Team member Arnold Shibu-Thomas:

  **Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project (give a short answer). 
  
  I feel like I worked consistantly I made sure to start working since the start of this sprint and worked almost every day of the sprint to implement the important features as soon as possible(and knock out some tasks). I made commits often to ensure that there was some movement on the tiaga board early on. I was able to coordinate meeting with the team and communicate with them effetivley. I also tried to help the team if they were stuck or needed a peer review. I did have to spend alot of time doing research over the couse of this sprint in order to figure out how buttons and other swing componenets worked! It was busy for me at work and with other assignment, but I kept my pace consistant. I also tried to ensure everything was working and maintainable with Junit tests and checkstyles!

#### Team member David:

  **Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project (give a short answer). 
  
   I honestly don't feel like I worked consistently and put in enough effort. I got hung up on Assignment 5 and another assignment for a different class
   and after spending to much time on Assignment 5 there weren't as many tasks left as I would have liked to work on. That being said, I did make it to 
   every meeting and did my best to repond to to all questions asked in our team discord. Overall I feel I could of done better, but under the workload 
   I think I did the best I could.

#### Team member William Mastronardi:

  **Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project (give a short answer). 
  
   I felt that I did not contribute enough to the team this sprint. Arnold and David did most of the work, and I lagged behind because 
   I ran into time management issues as well as dedicating time to learning the tools within the GUI.
