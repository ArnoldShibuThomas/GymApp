# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details. Also make sure this thing is well formatted and the links are links in here. 

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Gym Planning

**Sprint Number:** 2

**Scrum Master**: Arnold

**Git Master**: David

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** Testing and Creating Gym Scheduling Functionality

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  8

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 11
> Answer the questions below about your Sprint Planning?

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

> These user stories were added because they best fit the goal of this sprint. We were able to complete 7 user stories in Sprint 1, and there is more time in Sprint 2 to allow for potentially more user stories to be completed.

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

> These tests correlate to testing of the system and focus on creating more functionality that corresponds to the topic.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes, the concepts of the goals are clear. The codebase and Java Swing are a tad finnicky so there could be clarification required throughout the Sprint.



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2, and Continuous Integration starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that). 

| Date  | Who did NOT attend  |Meeting notes (very brief)   | Burndown Info (on track, ahead behind is enough) | GitHub Actions info (does the master pass) | Additional Info  |

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**: [Sprint 2 Screen Cast](https://youtu.be/FJO5wXBv7EM)

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> The value we created in this sprint was providing some functionality that was important to the Owner and ensuring that it was well tested and functioned appriopriately.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> Arnold, David, and Will were short the remaining team members, so in that situation we decided to put in extra work to ensure that the product could meet the deliverable deadline with substantial progress. Since this sprint was planned out with the expectations that there would be 4-5 people working on it and at the end there were only 3 people left that were working on it. The amount of work the 3 people(Arnold, David, and Will) put in was substatinally more than what was expected.

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> We would say that we have meet customer expectation. There are more things that can be used by the customer(since this sprint was more UI work than the first) that wasn't there previously and unlike last sprint most of the work we have put in requires less of a demonstration from a developer to show the progress. 


### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> We meet a majority of the goal this sprint. We have run tests on important aspects of the program and we also have more functionality avaliable to the user in terms of the gym program. We still need to work on the scheduling aspect of our program, but a mojority of this sprint set us up to finalize this for the last sprint.

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> No, we failed to get all stories in the sprint backlog done.

**If not, what went wrong?**

> We were unable to get all the stories complete in the sprint backlog. As mentioned above we planned this sprint to be for 4-5 people, but since one of our team memeber(Alexandra) dropped this course midway through the sprint and we didn't not hearing back from our other team memeber(Monique and Anna), it made it reduced the amount of people working on the sprint to just 3. We did manage as a team of 3 to pull a significant amount of stories into being finished, but not all of them. 

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> We worked at a consistant rate, but most of the tasks this time around required a bit more research and debugging it took a bit longer accomplish. Some tasks and stories took a day or two. There was a bit of working that was started at the middle and closer to the end of the sprint as a result. 

**Did you deliver business value?**

> We would argue that we contributed to the business value of the system, however not as much as we would have liked due to the staffing issue and outside obstacles that were out of our control at time.

**Did you follow the Scrum process (e.g. move Tasks correctly?, keep the Taiga board up to date? work consistently?)**

> Yes, the Taiga board was kept up to date throughout the sprint.

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint? (not needed for last Sprint)**

> Communication got better this sprint, but the one thing that we need to consider fo next sprint is having userstories and tasks that can be doable with a smaller team since there will only be the 3 of us heading into sprint 3. So planning needs to improve and that would the biggest thing that needs to be thought about.

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

>  Given the circumstances of the project, the progress made has left us feeling optimistic with the progress made and the future contributions into the system. Since we are a smaller team now and know what we can handle now, we feel optimistic with how we will do in this coming sprint.

### Contributions:

> In this section I want you to point me to your main contributions (each of you individually) for the current Sprint. Some of the below you will only need starting in later Sprints, I marked when they become important. 

Copy the section for each team member and then everyone adds their individual contributions. 

#### Team member Arnold Shibu-Thomas:

  **Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project (give a short answer). 
  
  I feel like I worked consistantly I made sure to start working since the start of this sprint and worked almost every day of the sprint to implement the important features as soon as possible(and knock out some tasks). I made commits often to ensure that there was some movement on the tiaga board early on. I was able to coordinate meeting with the team and communicate with them effetivley. I also tried to help the team if they were stuck or needed a perr review. I did have to spend alot of time doing research over the couse of this sprint in order to figure out how buttons and other swing componenets worked! It was busy for me at work and with other assignment, but I kept my pace consistant.

#### Team member David Hanley:

  **Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project (give a short answer). 

I believe given the homework load and on going work crisis I put in an adequate amount of time for the project. I hope with Sprint 3 to be able to put more time in and hopefully continue to assist the team in developing a project we can be proud of.
