# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details. Also make sure this thing is well formatted and the links are links in here. 

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Gym Scheduling

**Sprint Number:** 1

**Scrum Master**:  David Hanley

**Git Master**: William Mastronardi

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** Functionality, design, and ensuring system reflects Gym Scheduling.

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog: 14

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint: 11
> Answer the questions below about your Sprint Planning?

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

> The US that we added focused on the design and functionality of the system.

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

> The program needs a functional backend before the UI is altered to fit the system. A working state is necessary for the system prior to moving into large changes, such as the functionality related to the Gym Scheduling software.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes, fix memoranda and alter the system slightly to allow UI to be altered in a later sprint.



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2, and Continuous Integration starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that). 

| Date  | Who did NOT attend  |Meeting notes (very brief)   | Burndown Info (on track, ahead behind is enough) | GitHub Actions info (does the master pass) | Additional Info  |
|---|---|---|---|--|--|
| 10/25  |  Monique Devaugn, Anna Lehner, Alexandra Barletta-Chacon  | Standup notes for each individual were posted in the slack channel  | On track  | dev worked after each commit, master has not been changed  | Familiarized ourselves with Memoranda |
| 10/27  |  Anna Lehner, Alexandra Barletta-Chacon | Standup notes for each individual were posted in the slack channel  | Behind  | dev worked after each commit, master has not been changed  | Monique reached out with current status in the project |
| 10/30  |  Monique Devaugn, Anna Lehner, Alexandra Barletta-Chacon | Standup notes for each individual were posted in the slack channel  | Behind  | merging dev to master  | Prepared to merge dev and master, and discussed state of the project going forward |


## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

**Screen Cast link**: [Screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7l5waEfcXqU&ab_channel=WilliamMastronardi)

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

> We have been able to explore the functionality of the program and created a foundation that can be built upon with the future sprints.

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> Arnold, David, and Will were short the remaining team members, so in that situation we decided to put in extra work to ensure that the product could meet the deliverable deadline with substantial progress.

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> We have began to approach the customers' expectations, however we have not been able to implement the Interface aspect, so the customer would not be able to see the progress made without a demonstration from a developer.


### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> We have began to acheive the functionality and the system reflection of the gym scheduling system.

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> No.

**If not, what went wrong?**

> Due to the lack of communication from the remaining team members, we were unable to manage the total workload allocated for this sprint.

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> We managed a strong pace of progress made throughout the sprint.

**Did you deliver business value?**

> We would argue that we contributed to the business value of the system, however not as much as we would have liked due to the staffing issue.

**Did you follow the Scrum process (e.g. move Tasks correctly?, keep the Taiga board up to date? work consistently?)**

> Yes, the Taiga board was kept up to date throughout the sprint.

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint? (not needed for last Sprint)**

> Communication from the entire team would be a large factor in what the team could do better in.

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> Given the circumstances of the project, the progress made has left us feeling optimistic with the progress made and the future contributions into the system.

### Contributions:

> In this section I want you to point me to your main contributions (each of you individually) for the current Sprint. Some of the below you will only need starting in later Sprints, I marked when they become important. 

Copy the section for each team member and then everyone adds their individual contributions. 



   #### Team member Arnold Shibu-Thomas:

  **Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project (give a short answer). 
 
 I felt as though I worked consistantly. I started working since the start of the sprint on monday when I worked on minimize to the end when I finished the backend for owner. I tried to commit every day or every other day depending on if I was busy. I also tried to ensure i communicated my sucesses and failures to my team to ensure we could fix the issue together.

   #### Team member David Hanley:

  **Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project (give a short answer). 
  
I think I worked as consistently as possible. I think my individual contribution suffered due to a crisis at work, but I was able to help both my group members with coding as well as just sharing things I find about the code or tips I figured out.

   #### Team member Will Mastronardi:

  **Do you think you individually worked consistently and put in enough work into the project (give a short answer). 
  
  
 I feel that I contributed to the project consistently, I combed through a majority of the code to look for deprecated libraries. While looking through the code I found some functionality that assisted the team in a way that it made other user stories and tasks easier. Furthermore given the state of the team outside of David and Arnold, I felt that I communicated  promptly and thoroughly any progress made throughout the sprint.
